# HR-Data-Mining

Final project - Computer Science 

Implementation of a tool aimed to data forecasting over an HR system using data and text mining.

This work shows the development of a World Wide Web (Web) tool to data mining over a Human Resources (HR), 
which aims to detect patterns in the turnover of a specific HR. In more detail aim to identify groups 
that have a tendency of been fired or to resign, modify the C4.5 algorithm to allow attributes provides
by the text mining, demonstrate a forecasting search on the decision tree, and measure the importance 
and legitimacy of the generated information to the HR. For the data mining was used the decision tree method
over the C4.5 algorithm, in this algorithm was introduced the text mining through an attribute of the same type. 

Throughout the generated decision tree was used the Predicted Model Markup Language (PMML) to do a search in the dismissal data. 

Finally demonstrating that the tool is efficient to help in the decision-making relative to turnover.
